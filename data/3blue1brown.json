Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.\n\nRelated videos.\nCalculus series:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr\n\nThe sum giving pi^2 / 6:\nhttps://youtu.be/d-o3eB9sfls\n\nThe sum giving pi / 4:\nhttps://youtu.be/NaL_Cb42WyY\nhttps://youtu.be/00w8gu2aL-w (Mathologer)\n\n-------------------\nVideo timeline (thanks to user \"noonesperfect\")\n0:00:14 - Question 1\n0:02:29 - Answer 1\n0:06:27 - Prime nos. in Infinite Geometric Series (Basel problem) and their relationship with Natural logarithm\n0:12:01 - More examples of prime numbers in infinite series and their relationship with ln\n0:17:25 - Question 2\n0:19:20 - Answer 2 and explanation using ln\n0:22:25 - Question 3 and families of curves\n0:26:37 - Answer 3 and explanation\n0:28:50 - Imaginary exponential\n0:30:57 - Derivatives of exponential terms\n0:37:21 - Why derivative of e^t is the same as that e^t itself?\n0:41:21 - Question 4\n0:44:12 - Answer 4 and explanation using Python\n0:46:02 - Taylor Series for e^x\n0:48:29 - Derivatives of polynomial terms/Derivatives of e^x\n0:50:56 - Derivative of natural logarithm using graph  \n0:56:07 - Question 5\n0:57:37 - Answer 5 and explanation \n1:02:15 - Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant\n1:08:37 - Question 6\n1:12:41 - Connecting dots to the familiarity of different expression in math\n\n------------------\nThe live question setup with stats on-screen is powered by Itempool.\nhttps://itempool.com/\n\nCurious about other animations?\nhttps://www.3blue1brown.com/faq#manim\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.\n\nRelated videos.\nCalculus series:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr\n\nThe sum giving pi^2 / 6:\nhttps://youtu.be/d-o3eB9sfls\n\nThe sum giving pi / 4:\nhttps://youtu.be/NaL_Cb42WyY\nhttps://youtu.be/00w8gu2aL-w (Mathologer)\n\n-------------------\nVideo timeline (thanks to user \"noonesperfect\")\n0:00:14 - Question 1\n0:02:29 - Answer 1\n0:06:27 - Prime nos. in Infinite Geometric Series (Basel problem) and their relationship with Natural logarithm\n0:12:01 - More examples of prime numbers in infinite series and their relationship with ln\n0:17:25 - Question 2\n0:19:20 - Answer 2 and explanation using ln\n0:22:25 - Question 3 and families of curves\n0:26:37 - Answer 3 and explanation\n0:28:50 - Imaginary exponential\n0:30:57 - Derivatives of exponential terms\n0:37:21 - Why derivative of e^t is the same as that e^t itself?\n0:41:21 - Question 4\n0:44:12 - Answer 4 and explanation using Python\n0:46:02 - Taylor Series for e^x\n0:48:29 - Derivatives of polynomial terms/Derivatives of e^x\n0:50:56 - Derivative of natural logarithm using graph  \n0:56:07 - Question 5\n0:57:37 - Answer 5 and explanation \n1:02:15 - Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant\n1:08:37 - Question 6\n1:12:41 - Connecting dots to the familiarity of different expression in math\n\n------------------\nThe live question setup with stats on-screen is powered by Itempool.\nhttps://itempool.com/\n\nCurious about other animations?\nhttps://www.3blue1brown.com/faq#manim\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

                "description": "A story of mathematical play.\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\nBrought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/spiral-thanks\n\nBased on this Math Stack Exchange post:\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/885879/meaning-of-rays-in-polar-plot-of-prime-numbers/885894\n\nWant to learn more about rational approximations?  See this Mathologer video.\nhttps://youtu.be/CaasbfdJdJg\n\nAlso, if you haven't heard of Ulam Spirals, you may enjoy this Numberphile video:\nhttps://youtu.be/iFuR97YcSLM\n\nDirichlet's paper:\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1408.pdf\n\nImportant error correction: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By \"allowable\", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.\n\nDirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vall\u00e9e Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.\n\nIn many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!\n\nMy apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.\n\nDirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vall\u00e9e Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.\n\nIn many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!\n\nMy apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

It's all about teaching math visually.  Take a look and see if there's anything you'd like to learn.\n\nNY Times blog post about this problem:\nhttps://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/\n\nThe original paper by Gregory Galperin:\nhttps://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf\n\nEvidently, Numberphile also described this problem (I had not known):\nhttps://youtu.be/abv4Fz7oNr0\nYou'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

It's all about teaching math visually.  Take a look and see if there's anything you'd like to learn.\n\nNY Times blog post about this problem:\nhttps://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/\n\nThe original paper by Gregory Galperin:\nhttps://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf\n\nEvidently, Numberphile also described this problem (I had not known):\nhttps://youtu.be/abv4Fz7oNr0\nYou'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  \n\nThis means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.  See the above article for more information.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti: \nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

                    "description": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is just one specific example of a much more general, relatable, non-quantum phenomenon.\nBrought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/uncertainty-thanks\nAnd by Art of Problem Solving: http://aops.com/3b1b\n\nFor more on quantum mechanical wave functions, I highly recommend this video by udiprod:\nhttps://youtu.be/p7bzE1E5PMY\n\nMinute physics on special relativity:\nhttps://youtu.be/1rLWVZVWfdY\n\nMain video on the Fourier transform\nhttps://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY\n\nLouis de Broglie thesis: \nhttp://aflb.ensmp.fr/LDB-oeuvres/De_Broglie_Kracklauer.pdf\n\nMore on Doppler radar:\nRadar basics: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278808\n\nThere's a key way in which the description I gave of the trade-off in Doppler radar differs from reality.  Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  \n\nThis means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.  See the above article for more information.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti: \nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

Yay for active learning!\nhttps://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning\n\nI also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/\n\nFor more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning: \nhttps://youtu.be/i8D90DkCLhI\nhttps://youtu.be/bxe2T-V8XRs\n\nFor those of you looking to go *even* deeper, check out the text \"Deep Learning\" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  \n\nAlso, the publication Distill is just utterly beautiful: https://distill.pub/\n\nLion photo by Kevin Pluck\n\n-----------------\nTimeline: \n0:00 - Introduction example\n1:07 - Series preview\n2:42 - What are neurons?\n3:35 - Introducing layers\n5:31 - Why layers?\n8:38 - Edge detection example\n11:34 - Counting weights and biases\n12:30 - How learning relates\n13:26 - Notation and linear algebra\n15:17 - Recap\n16:27 - Some final words\n17:03 - ReLU vs Sigmoid\n\n------------------\nAnimations largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.

For those who know what this is, it's kind of fun to puzzle about why this is the case.\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

The triangle of power is an alternate notation, which I find to be absolutely beautiful.\n\n(This is the corrected version of the one I put out a month or so ago, in which my animation for all the inverse operations was incorrect)\n\nHere's a sketch from the math redditer Cosmologicon showing how this might be usual with practical space considerations: http://i.imgur.com/hAeJokq.jpg\n\nThis original comes from an answer to a math exchange post by Alex Jordan, which you can find here: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30046/alternative-notation-for-exponents-logs-and-roots\n\nI also briefly flashed a blog post with another interesting alternative for logarithm notation: http://www.solidangl.es/2015/04/a-radical-new-look-for-logarithms.html"
